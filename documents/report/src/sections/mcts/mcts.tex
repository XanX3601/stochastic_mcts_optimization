\label{sec:mcts}

\Gls{mcts} is a family of algorithm based on Monte Carlo simulations and on a tree search procedure.
Monte Carlo simulations were first introduced on the game of Go in 1993 \cite{mcgo} as a way to evaluate a state of the game.
It then has been well applied on the game of Go where it gave state of the art results.
Nowadays, \gls{mcts} algorithm are still used alongside neural networks such as Alpha Zero \cite{alphazero}.
It has also been applied to other domain such as resolving optimization problem \cite{survey_mcts} such as Traveling Salesman Problem, Function Approximation and so on.
