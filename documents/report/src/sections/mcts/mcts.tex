\section{\acrlong{mcts} algorithm}%
\label{sec:mcts_algorithm}

\gls{mcts} algorithm is a family of algorithm based on Monte-Carlo simulations and a tree seach procedure.
Monte-Carlo simulations were first used in 1993~\cite{mcgo} for the game of Go.
In 2006~\cite{uct}, \gls{mcts} most popular algorithm called \gls{uct} was introduced.
It used multi armed bandit in the tree search procedure to keep a balance between exploitation and exploration of the tree.
Which, respectively means to study more a well known and good strategy and explore new stategies.
Nowadays, \gls{mcts} algorithms have been used in many domains~\cite{survey_mcts} and still give state of the art result in many of them.
For example, it is a core component of algorithms such as AlphaZero~\cite{alphazero}.

Here, we are interested in solving optimization problems, that can also be seen as games or puzzle.
Moreover, we have a particular interest in stochastic problems.
In this section, we will discuss the different classic components of a \gls{mcts} algorithm.
We will first discuss the preliminaries to understand the \gls{mcts}.
