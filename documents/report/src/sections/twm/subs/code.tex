\subsection{How code \acrshort{twm} actions}%
\label{sub:how_code_twm_actions}

In this section we will discuss of how we codify actions for the \gls{twm} as defined in section~\ref{sub:definition_of_the_twm_problem}.
The \gls{twm} is a multi-agent problem. 
Each team of firefighter can be control on their own.
We decided to have them play in sequence and not in parallel.
Meaning that, we identify each team by a number and then, team 1 play, then team 2, etc\dots
This way, the algorithm can place team one by one.
It is important to do so because teams can be stacked on the same cell to extinguish it faster or can be spread across the grid to cover the fire.
