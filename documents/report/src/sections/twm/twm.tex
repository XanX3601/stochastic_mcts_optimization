\section{\acrlong{twm}}%
\label{sec:twm}

The \gls{twm} is an optimization problem that has many real life applications.
As we have these last few years, giant forest fire are more and more vivid, frequent and dangerous.
This problem modelize such a fire and the teams of firefighters that must extinguished it.
We use the modelization presented by \citeauthor{comp_mcts_mo}\cite{comp_mcts_mo}.
As they say themselves, this problem is of practical use and is challenging but enough simple to test the \gls{snrpa}.

We will first present the modelization of the \gls{twm} and we will proceed to the codification of the actions we used for the \gls{snrpa}.
