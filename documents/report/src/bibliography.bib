abstract = {For large state-space Markovian Decision Problems Monte-Carlo planning is one of the few viable approaches to find near-optimal solutions. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, UCT, that applies bandit ideas to guide Monte-Carlo planning. In finite-horizon or discounted MDPs the algorithm is shown to be consistent and finite sample bounds are derived on the estimation error due to sampling. Experimental results show that in several domains, UCT is significantly more efficient than its alternatives.},

abstract="In this paper, we are interested in the minimization of the travel cost of the traveling salesman problem with time windows. In order to do this minimization we use a Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm. NRPA has multiple levels and maintains the best tour at each level. It consists in learning a rollout policy at each level. We also show how to improve the original algorithm with a modified rollout policy that helps NRPA to avoid time windows violations.",
